# NeumannOS (Rust port)

This directory holds a Rust port of the MINIX 3.1.0 sources in the rest of
this repository (see the top-level `README.md` for the original C
codebase's history). It is a **starting skeleton**, not a finished port: a
real microkernel, its servers (`pm`, `fs`, `rs`, ...), and its drivers are a
multi-month undertaking on their own. What's here boots in QEMU, sets up
exception handling, prints the boot image, and exercises message-passing
IPC — enough to build the rest of the system on top of.

**Porting philosophy:** the C tree is kept as the behavioral spec — process
numbers, message/call numbers, the device-driver protocol
(`DEV_OPEN`/`DEV_READ`/...), and the `pm`/`fs`/`rs` division of
responsibilities are carried over faithfully, so every design question
already has a settled answer and the existing `test/` POSIX suite is a
real target to eventually validate against. What is *not* carried over is
the C implementation style: no transliterated `message` unions, privilege
bitmasks, or `PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE` macros — each subsystem is rebuilt in
idiomatic, type-safe Rust (enums, `Result`, ownership) around the same
external contract.

## What's implemented

- `src/com.rs` — process numbers and notification types, ported from
  `include/minix/com.h`.
- `src/table.rs` — the boot image (fixed process list), ported from
  `kernel/table.c`'s `image[]`.
- `src/ipc.rs` — `Message` (ported from the `mess_*`/`message` union in
  `include/minix/ipc.h`) plus `send`/`receive`/`notify`, a non-blocking
  stand-in for MINIX's `SEND`/`RECEIVE`/`NOTIFY` kernel calls.
- `src/gdt.rs` — Global Descriptor Table and Task State Segment, ported from
  the segment/TSS setup in `kernel/protect.c`. Its only real job right now
  is giving the double-fault handler a dedicated stack (via the TSS's
  Interrupt Stack Table), so a fault during fault delivery — e.g. a kernel
  stack overflow — is reported instead of triple-faulting the CPU.
- `src/interrupts.rs` — the IDT and CPU exception handlers, ported from the
  single vector-indexed dispatcher in `kernel/exception.c`. The C version
  turns a fault into a POSIX signal for a user process or panics for a
  kernel task; with no user processes yet, every handler here takes the
  "kernel task" branch (report and halt), except `#BP` (breakpoint), which
  reports and returns — exercised by a self-test in `main.rs`.
- `src/serial.rs` + `src/main.rs` — boot entry point (via the `bootloader`
  crate): loads the GDT/IDT, runs a breakpoint self-test, prints the boot
  image table over COM1, and runs a send/receive/notify self-test.

## What's not implemented yet (roadmap)

Roughly in the order the original kernel needs them:

1. ~~**GDT/IDT and exception handling**~~ — done (`src/gdt.rs`,
   `src/interrupts.rs`). CPU faults are now reported instead of silently
   triple-faulting.
2. **A real scheduler and process table** (`kernel/proc.c`, `kernel/proto.h`)
   — actual context switching between processes, not just an in-kernel
   mailbox array.
3. **User-mode processes and address-space isolation** — right now
   everything (including "servers") runs in kernel context. Blocking
   `send`/`receive` (parking a process until a partner is ready) only makes
   sense once there are processes to park.
4. **Kernel calls** (`kernel/system.c`, `kernel/system/do_*.c`) — the
   privileged operations servers need (`sys_vircopy`, `sys_setalarm`, etc.).
5. **The servers themselves**: `pm` (process manager), `fs` (file system),
   `rs` (reincarnation server), `tty`, `memory`, in roughly that dependency
   order, matching `servers/` and `drivers/` in the C tree.
6. **A libc-equivalent** for whatever runs in user mode, mirroring `lib/`.

## Building

Requires a nightly Rust toolchain (for `-Z build-std`, needed because this
targets bare metal and has no prebuilt `core`/`alloc` for it) and the
`bootimage` cargo subcommand:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview --toolchain nightly
cargo install bootimage
```

Then, from `rust/kernel/`:

```
rustup override set nightly    # only needed once per checkout
cargo build                    # compiles the kernel binary
cargo bootimage                # wraps it in a bootable BIOS disk image
```

This produces
`rust/target/x86_64-unknown-none/debug/bootimage-neumannos-kernel.bin`.

The target (`x86_64-unknown-none`) and build flags are pinned in
`kernel/.cargo/config.toml`. Notably, `rustflags` forces
`relocation-model=static`: the builtin target defaults to a
position-independent executable, which the `bootloader` 0.9 crate's simple
ELF loader does not relocate, causing the kernel to jump into garbage on
boot if left at the default.

## Running

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86_64-unknown-none/debug/bootimage-neumannos-kernel.bin -serial stdio
```

(or `cargo run`, which invokes `bootimage runner` per `.cargo/config.toml`
and does the same thing). Expected output on COM1: the boot image table,
followed by the IPC self-test results, then a halt message.
